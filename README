A few quick hacks that I put together one afternoon to feed custom control data
into Google Earth, emulating a joystick. 

We use this in combination with Liquid Galaxy to control a number of linked
GE instances on our university display wall. It's pretty tied to our hardware,
but it might be useful to someone.

It's in three parts, 'fakenav' and 'kinect'.

fakenav:
- This is what feeds data into GE. GE needs to be configured to read from a 
SpaceNavigator joystick device, that is actually this program. We make a named
pipe, by default named '/tmp/fakenav'.
- fakenav reads from a network socket. It expects 6 floats, comma seperated, 
ending with a newline

kinect:
- This requires the setup and libraries on:

- It is adapted from the 'player' example that comes with those libraries
- Connects over the network to the fakedev program

sdlcontrol:
- this lets you use keyboard or joystick from a remote machine. We use it with
a USB DDR mat.
